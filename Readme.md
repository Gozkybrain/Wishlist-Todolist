# Wishlist To-Do List

This repository contains a simple web application for managing your wishlist items using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I developed this project about a year ago and have decided to share it on GitHub today. The Wishlist To-Do List enables users to keep track of items they wish to purchase or accomplish, facilitating organization and priority setting for their desires.

## Features

- **Add Items:** Users can input the name and description of the desired item to add it to their wishlist.
- **Mark as Completed:** When a wishlist item has been acquired or achieved, users can mark it as completed.
- **Remove Items:** Users have the option to remove items from their wishlist if they are no longer of interest.
- **Responsive Design:** The web application features a responsive design, ensuring optimal usability across various screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Utilized for structuring the web page's content.
- **CSS:** Applied for visually enhancing and styling the user interface.
- **JavaScript:** Implemented to introduce interactivity and manage the wishlist's functionality.
